# Merge can go three ways:
# * F: fast forward: no commit is created, only a ref is changed
# * A: automatic: true merge (non-ff) without conflicts. A new commit is created
# * C: merge with conflicts: no commit is created but the index is prepared (partially)
#      for a merge commit

# How it appears on reflog:
# eccb159 master@{0}: commit (merge): Merge branch 'qa'   -> When there is a conflict (C)
# d021b0e master@{1}: merge qa: Merge made by recursive.  -> Automatic (A)
# e1cde23 master@{2}: merge qa: Fast-forward              -> Fast-forward (F)

# For cases F and A, the "post-merge" hook is called, but for case C, just the
# "post-commit" is called, so we need to do the verification there, too.

###############################################################################
# Warns if you try
